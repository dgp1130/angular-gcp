# Angular GCP

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.6.

## Setup

* Install `gcloud`.
* Log in with `gcloud init`.

## Deployment

* Run `npm run deploy`.

Production instance runs at https://frontend-glud4nxwta-uw.a.run.app/ (if I'm
still paying to keep it up).

## Development server

Use `npm run frontend:dev` to start a live-reloading dev server of the Angular
application.

In a separate terminal, use `npm run backend:dev` to start the backend server in
watch mode.

Both servers are necessary to run the application locally.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
